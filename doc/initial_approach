Initial approach

1. Segmentation
	- As in assignment 5 with morphological operations.
	- Threshold dark stuff.
	
2. Find spherical structuers as in assignment 3 (3d). Assumption: little to no pathways.

3. Aggregate mask to single nodules.
	- Assignment 4 (Connected Components module).
	- Then find center (average of positions).

4. Write nodule positions to file.

Optional Noise filtering:
	- See assignment 3.4
	
Filter out air pathways:
	- See assignment 5 on vessel detection.
	- Skeleton growing.
