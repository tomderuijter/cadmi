Lung segmentation (1 min)
- Thresholding and outside region growing
	- procedure
		* Image -> Image -> Image
	- strict and leniant
		* Images of both types
	- problems
		- in or exclusion of membrane
			* Image of candidates on wall
		- nodules attached to membrane
			* Image of dissapeared nodule
		- overlap with lower abdomen
			* Image
		- other artifacts
			* Image

Candidate selection (3 min)
- Estimating quality of candidates
	- Annotation based statistics
	- Feature based (count, volume, ...)
- Single threshold
	* Image & stats
- Multiple threshold
	* Image & stats
- Threshold with airway removal
	* Images (before and after) & stats
- Seedpoints from Hessian features
	* Image per type
- Per voxel classification
	* Image (probability density) & stats
	- Features and annotations

Feature extraction (2 min)
- List of features
	* Philosophy: more is better
	- Greyscale features
	- Geometrical features
	- Vesselness
	- Hessian features (blobness, curvedness, ... )
	- Distance based features
- Quality of features
	* Images of graphs (poor feature vs. great feature)
	- separation of classes

Preprocessing (2 min)
- Resampling negatives
- Feature based thresholding for false positive reduction
	* Images of feature graph with thresholds added
	- Single features
	- Combined features

Evaluation (3 min)
- Train set
	- Cross validation on subjects
	- Cumulative FROC, mean FROC and AUC
	- Visualisation for specific false positives
- Test set
	- Visualisation based on location and common sense

Classification (2 min)
- Classifiers
	- Random forest
		- Non-deterministic, Robust, Probabilistic interpretation
	- Logistic regression
		- Deterministic, Fast, robust, probabilistic interpretation
	- Ridge Classifier
		- Deterministic, fast, parameter dependent, non-proba interpretation
- Parameter selection
	- Grid search per subject
